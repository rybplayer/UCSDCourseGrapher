# UCSDCourseGrapher
[ARCHIVED] What does a graph of all UCSD classes look like?

This project started by trying to answer the question, "What class at UCSD has the longest chain of prerequisites?"
That is, if you were to come with no credit, assuming all classes were available every quarter, what class would take the most quarters to meet the prerequisites for?

This led to many interesting and unexpected results, as well as a few debatably useful visualizations of common course sequences.
